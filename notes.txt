Locations/World separated
Locations as map classes
locations have an explore event, grabs list of events that could happen
dungeons can randomly get a "findexit" event after x explores

EVENTS planning
---------------
Player is in map, uses explore command on game loop input.
 Input calls explore event from the map we're in.
  Explore event looks at list of events, picks one randomly (weighted plz) and calls said event's run_event.
